Kids Speed Car

After playing around with a bobbycar with hoverboard motors and the problem, that you can build one and for changes, everything has to be checked.

So I decided to build it modular with exchangeable components and multiple microcontrollers.

The controllers commincate via ESP-NOW ever WiFi, the original hoverboard mainboard has with this design a wireless communication interface.

It will be swappable so multiple car designs are possible. At the moment, there are plans for
- Bobbycar (simple, fast, mainly only the motors and a controller)
- Electric car (A kids electric car with really a lot of enhancements)
- Lawn mover (Same controller structure, different peripherals)

At the moment, it is really WiP, mostly build from scratch, so wait to get the results

I'm trying to add a HAMA Thunder V5 racing wheel to the car, to get all buttons, the shift pedals working to control
